# DCS-The-Way-Changer
 This project provides a User interface to change the waypoint data created by the ["DCS The Way" project (BlueFinBima fork)](https://github.com/BlueFinBima/DCS-The-Way/).  "DCS The Way" allows the creation of waypoints on the DCS World F10 map which wen saved to an external file, can then be loaded into this program to be further tweaked.  Once all good, then the changed file can then be loaded back into "DCS The Way" in order to be loaded back into the aircraft.

The "DCS The Way Changer" is able to set more detailed information about a waypoint for certain aircraft (_currently only the AH-64D Apache_).  While adding and cloning waypoints is supported in the "DCS The Way Changer" it is anticipated that collection will take place in "DCS The Way".
